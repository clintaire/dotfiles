# Neovim configuration files

[Source :: Samyak Sarnayak | GitHub](https://github.com/Samyak2/)

My custom neovim configuration written in (mostly) lua.

## Requirements

- neovim v0.9.5 (untested on other versions, might work)
- [ripgrep](https://github.com/BurntSushi/ripgrep#installation)
  - for telescope fuzzy finding in files
- `go` (>=1.16)
  - to install [`efm`](https://github.com/mattn/efm-langserver) which provides linting and formatting for many languages
- `gcc`
  - to build treesitter parsers
  - only needed when the treesitter plugin is installed/updated
  - If you use nix, see `shell.nix` that includes dependencies for this
- (optional) `yarn`
  - to install [iamcco/markdown-preview.nvim](https://github.com/iamcco/markdown-preview.nvim)
  - delete `lua/plugins/markdown_plugins.lua` if you don't need this
<!--  -->
## Usage

- Plugins
  - See [Lazy.nvim](https://github.com/folke/lazy.nvim?tab=readme-ov-file#-usage)
  - Use `:Lazy sync` to update plugins
- LSP
  - After opening a file you want LSP support for, run `:LspInstall` and select the server you want installed. Restart neovim after it completes. This uses [mason-lspconfig.nvim](https://github.com/williamboman/mason-lspconfig.nvim)
  - See `lua/lsp/init.lua` for keybinds set for LSP stuff

## Code structure

All lua files are formatted using stylua.

- `init.lua`: main file which Neovim loads
- `vimscript`: legacy vimscript stuff that could not be ported over to Lua
- `lua`
  - `plugins/`
    - If you don't want/need some of them, simply delete those files
  - `lsps.lua` and `lsp/`
  - `misc.lua`: other configurations such as line numbers, splits, tabs, whitespaces, colorschemes, etc.
  - Other files are plugin-specific configurations. I should probably move them.
